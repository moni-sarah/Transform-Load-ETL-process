# Transform-Load-ETL-process
create an automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to extract daily weather forecasts and observed weather data and load it into a live report to be used for further analysis by the analytics team.



# Tasked with creating an automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, I'm focusing on gathering daily weather forecasts and observing weather data for Casablanca, Morocco. This information will be loaded into a live report to monitor the historical accuracy of temperature forecasts from a single source and station. Initially, I'll target one station and source, extracting actual and forecasted temperatures for noon each day. This proof-of-concept will pave the way for expanding the report to include multiple locations, forecasting sources, update frequencies, and additional weather metrics like wind speed, precipitation, and visibility, supporting broader prediction modeling efforts.
